# Gasoline Price Impact Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete research and analysis for the project **"The Predictive Power of Gasoline Prices on Energy Markets"**. It explores the relationship between gasoline prices, energy sector returns, and market volatility, leveraging a range of financial and economic datasets from 2000 to 2023.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
- Exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and patterns in gasoline prices.
- Statistical analysis, including correlation studies and Granger causality tests.
- Predictive modeling using VAR and machine learning techniques to assess the impact of price volatility.
- Detailed discussion of the findings, including the implications for investors, policymakers, and energy companies.

## Competition Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Datathon 2025**, organized by Citadel and Correlation One. The competition challenged participants to derive meaningful insights from complex financial and economic datasets, focusing on real-world applications in the energy sector.

The goal was to explore the predictive power of gasoline prices for energy sector stock movements, leveraging statistical analysis, machine learning, and economic theory. This repository reflects our team's comprehensive approach to understanding these market dynamics, from initial data preprocessing to advanced predictive modeling.

Key highlights of the competition include:
- End-to-end data processing and feature engineering.
- Advanced machine learning techniques for financial forecasting.
- Real-world impact analysis for investors, policymakers, and industry stakeholders.
